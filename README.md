## Fmrk4sql - Freemarker for sql
**Fmrk4sql** - is true OOP library to easy way of use freemarker templates
that describe sql queries to databases. 

We need write sql queries in native way in cases when we do not use ORM
in our projects or when there is no ORM for database (clickhouse for example) or 
when we have complex queries that forces us to use native sql.

**Fmrk4sql** - is developing with OOP principles, without any procedural way of coding.
All we need is to create objects and use objects with only they responsibilities.
